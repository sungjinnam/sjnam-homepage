<p>
	Currently, I am involved in Custom Course Advising project of <a href='http://www.umich.edu/~uselab/'>USELab</a>, University of Michigan School of Information. </br></br>

	Every college student registers for courses from a catalog of numerous offerings each term. Selecting which courses in which to enroll, and in what combinations, can dramatically impact each student’s chances for academic success. Taking inspiration from the STEM Academy, we wanted to identify the characteristics of engineering students who graduate with 3.0 or above grade point average. The overall goal of the Customized Course Advising project is to determine the optimal term-by-term course selections for all engineering students based on their incoming characteristics and previous course history and performance, paying particular attention to concurrent enrollment. We found that ACT Math, SAT Math, and Advanced Placement exam can be effective measures to measure the students' academic preparation level. Also, we found that some concurrent course- enrollment patterns are highly predictive of first-term and overall academic success.

<p>
	Early Warning Systems (EWSs) are being developed and used more frequently across college campuses to aggregate multiple sources of data and provide timely information to various stakeholders about students in need of academic support. As these systems grow more complex in their ability to provide knowledge about a student’s developing grade trajectory, there is an increasing need to incorporate relevant and real-time course- related information that could be precursors to a student’s success or failure. This paper presents the initial investigation of how to incorporate additional information from students’ use of course resources from a Learning Management System (LMS) into an existing EWS. Specifically, we focus our efforts understanding the relationship between course resource use and a student’s grade. Using ten semesters of LMS data from a required Chemistry course, we categorized course resources into four distinct categories and used a multinomial logistic regression model with semester fixed-effects to estimate the impact of course resource use on the likelihood that a student receives an “A” or “B” in the course as compared to a “C.” Results suggest that students who use resources related to Exam Preparation or Lectures to a greater degree than their peers are more likely to receive an “A” or “B” in the course as compared to a “C”. We discuss the implications of our results for the further development of the EWS and EWSs in general.

<p>
	This paper suggests a novel way of collecting the reading pattern data from crowd, without interfering the usage of mobile devices, and generating highlighted texts automatically. Since the amount of information is expanding rapidly, people demand a support tool that can help them to acquire information in a short time. In the first experiment, we analyzed participants' reading behavior on the mobile devices by video recording. For the second experiment, we implemented a mobile application to gather more accurate reading pattern and generated the highlighted documents automatically. The satisfaction level of automatically highlighted documents was significantly higher than randomly highlighted document. We expect this automatic highlight generating method will suggest another way of using crowdsourced data.

<div class="contentDetails">	<h3>Enhancing Effectiveness of Skim Reading with Highlighting Text (2012)</h3>
	<img src = "http://lucidhole.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/eyetracking.png", width="300"/>

	<p>
		Due to enormous amount of information and limitation of time, online reading often requires skim reading rather than full-text reading. This study investigates a way of improving effectiveness of skimming as a strategy for understanding text in a relatively short time. We hypothesized that highlight could be of help to understand better and to allocate attention selectively on important phrases. In experiment, we asked participants to read text. At the same time, we used eye-tracking technology to record where they are looking at in the given text, and they also took a recall and comprehension tests. Results indicate that highlight plays more important role under skim reading than full-text reading condition. Highlight captures more fixation duration of gaze while skim reading, and it also leads readers to memorize more words in the text. For practical use of highlight, we suggest crowdsourcing as a method for sifting out key phrases from a text. To verify validity, we conducted a following experiment that participants choose phrases to be highlighted. The result informs that social highlight may be a useful method to construct skim reading aids.</p>

	<p>
	Hypothesis: 
	Attention capacity drain, caused by visual stimuli, will effect the task performance with the aural stimuli.</p>

	<p>
	Experiment Design:
	2 x 2 cross-sectional design experiment, measuring RT for auditory stimuli while presenting visual stimuli. Each task repeats for 7 times.</p>
	<p>
	1st experiment:</br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;-1st condition - 15 still visual targets with single sound stimulus</br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;-2nd condition - 35 moving visual targets with single sound stimulus
	</p>
	<p>
	2nd experiment:</br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;-1st condition - 15 still visual targets with dual sound stimuli</br>	
	&nbsp;&nbsp;-2nd condition - 35 moving visual targets with dual sound stimuli
	</p>
	<p>
	Result:
	Both experiments confirm that more visual stimuli interferes the reaction to the auditory stimuli.

	2nd experiment shows the effect of decision making task to the RT of auditory stimuli.</p>

	<p>Gestural Interface for Cars : Prototype of systematic arrangement for gesture using in passenger vehicles.</p>

	<p>
	The purpose of this project was to propose a gestural interface for a passenger vehicle. In this project, I collected the user-case information and developed a priority weight model, prototype gestures, and an evaluation model for the proposed gestures. From hundreds of user-cases, I created nine categories, elaborated upon them with contextual information, and proposed gesture inputs for each case. All user-cases were weighted and ordered by five criteria: pleasure, comfortableness, a sense of updated technology, safety, and ease of use. From this process, it was possible to extract the user's needs. Moreover, it was possible to measure the appropriateness of the relationship between the gestures and the user-cases, and the ease of a gestural interface, compared to the traditional button and lever interface. </p>

	With modern technology, reading can be done in a non-linear way. Extricating information from the book pages, we used a wall, a space that is not usually utilized but is broad enough, for marshaling and reprocessing much information.</br>
	'Surface' is a prototype of reading device that multiple texts can be laid out and the components can be rearranged to form a new sort of knowledge.
